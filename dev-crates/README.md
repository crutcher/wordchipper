# Dev Crates

This directory contains development crates for various purposes.

These crates exist for the development of the project and will have limited,
if any, utility to the end user.

Translation: they're unsupported jank hacks; but we need them.

If you find utility in something here, please find a way to lift it to a supported crate.
