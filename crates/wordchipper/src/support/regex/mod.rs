//! # Regex Utilities
//!
//! A number of popular in-use LLM Tokenizer Regex Patterns require extended regex
//! machinery provided by the [`fancy_regex`] crate; but naturally, this has performance
//! costs. We'd prefer to avoid using the [`fancy_regex`] crate when possible, falling back
//! on the standard [`regex`] crate when patterns permit this.
//!
//! This recurses into two problems:
//!
//! * Labeling Patterns - [`RegexPattern`]
//!   * [`RegexPattern::Basic`] - a pattern which was written for basic regular expressions.
//!   * [`RegexPattern::Fancy`] - a pattern which was written for regex extensions.
//!   * [`RegexPattern::Adaptive`] - unknown target, try basic; then fall-up to fancy.
//! * Wrapping Compiled Regex - [`RegexWrapper`]
//!
//! The [`RegexWrapper`] type supports only one operation, ``find_iter()`` which requires
//! some adaptation of the `Iterator` stream to function.
